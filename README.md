## About

The video game *Ultima V* comes with a printed *Book of Lore* that
includes a section on the music of its fictional land, Britannia, and
includes an example song, *Stones*. The style appears to be Medieval
"square notation" with a four line staff and odd note shapes, such as
the PORRECTUS.

![The Book of Lore: Music](../../raw/master/The%20Book%20of%20Lore:%20Music.jpg "Stones in pseudo-Medieval square notation")

Just for fun, I transcribed the music to ABC format. From that I
created sheet music for the song in both the treble clef (𝄞), which
most people are familiar with, and the Gregorian C clef (𝇐) used in
the book. The sheetmusic include the lyrics for all four verses,
although I did have to adjust them slightly where there were simply
too many syllables. (This might be a sign that I got the transcription
of the music wrong.)

## Notes

Transcription of musical notes from Ultima 5 Lore. "Stones"
It is from a four-line staff 𝄙, Medieval "square notation",
starting with a Gregorian C Clef (𝇐). 

Quarter notes: AB C_ DC B_ CB A_ ~slide thingy BAG,  eighth: D,
Quarter notes: AB C_ BC D_ CD eighth E_
-Brevis rest-
("custos" A at end of staff to foreshadow next line.)

Quarter notes: AB C_ DC B_ CB A_ (~slide thingy B)AG, eighth: D,
Quarter notes: AB C_ DC B_ AG,(~slidey thingy B)AB

eighth: |A|.


, after a note means one octave lower.
_ means there is a line over the note (episema, held a little longer)
. means there is a dot after the note (1 beat longer)
|| means there are vertical bars around the note

What I'm reading as eighth notes is a "semi-breve" (𝆺)
What I call quarter notes are "breve" (squares like 𝆸)
When I put notes adjacent without space, they are a "clivis" (𝅷𝇕), a
     single syllable, sung as two notes.

Squiggly thing is "quilisma"?

The note duration may not be right. (In medieval notation, a note with
a line on it lasted longer than a note without a line on it).
Why are there no longs ()? Why does every brevis have a line over it?
Why would the final note be a dotted eighth!?

I think long (𝆷), which looks like a quarter note, should be equal to
a half note or a dotted half note depending on the context (something
to do with dividing by threes). However, it's possible this is just
fake square notation (modern music notation). Evidence: stacked notes
that would be hard for a modern person to read, such as PODATUS, are
absent. 

The use of PORRECTUS is interesting, but not too confusing as it is a
simple slur.
