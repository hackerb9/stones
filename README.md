# stones
The video game *Ultima V* comes with a printed *Book of Lore* that includes a section on the music of its fictional land, Britannia, and includes an example song, *Stones*. The style appears to be Medieval "square notation" with a four line staff and odd note shapes, such as the PORRECTUS.

Just for fun, I created sheet music for the song in both the treble clef (which most people are familiar with) and the Gregorian C clef used in the book. The sheetmusic include the lyrics for all four verses, although I did have to adjust them slightly where there were simply too many syllables. (This might be a sign that I got the transcription of the music wrong.)
